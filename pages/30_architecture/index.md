# Basic Principal of the Software

The basic idea of the software is to use a **filter pipeline** to process the input image and generate [GCode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code) output. The *pipeline* uses filters to transform the data in filter stages.

## Pipelines
Filters are arranged and processed in a specific order, called a pipeline. 
Each filter takes a single action. For example, the Blur Filter takes an incoming video frame, applies a blur action to the image and then passes the new image to the next filter in the process.

The order of the filters matches the order on the left-hand side of the UI. Each filters effects is immediately visible in the preview video feed and can have some slider to adjust basic filter parameter.

## Output
After processing and converting the input image into vector data, the data is taken and converted to GCODE.  

CNC machines like routers or milling machines make use of a series of pre-programmed commands to, in subtractive processes, take material from your piece. The most popular programming language is G-Code, the creation of which marked an important step in the history of CAM. This language controls exactly how your CNC machineâ€™s tools move. From how fast your tools move to the speed of rotation, everything is covered in the G-Code. 

The generated GCode of this software can either send direct to your CNC machine which runs grbl or you can use bCNC as an host to connect to your machine.
