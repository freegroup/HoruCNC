CNC machines are an essential part of the hackerâ€™s toolset. These computer-controlled cutters of wood, metal and other materials can translate a design into a prototype in short order, making the process of iterating a project much easier. However, the software to create these designs can be expensive and complex.

The motivation for this project was to reduce the effort of toolpath generation and the frustration at the cost of commercial software.
